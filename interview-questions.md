# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is iteration?

  Your answer: An iteration is the process of completing steps until a condition is met. An example of iteration is making a sandwich! You will need to complete each step to complete the sandwich.

  Researched answer: Iteration is the process of repeating certain steps until it is told to stop or a certain condition is met. Technically speaking, each step is considered the end of of its iteration and the beginning of another



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: By using .map() there are 3 parameters.. .map(value,index, array). The (value) is what is the output of datatypes. example: var ex = "I am the value of this variable". <--- in this case, the value is the string! The (index) is the location of the value in the array. The (array) will return the array without any changes. The only parameter that is required for use is (value) because the parameters may only be used in order of (value, index, array) and with no value you will not be able do anything with that datatpye.

  Researched answer:The 3 parameters are value, index, and array. The value is what is being processed in the array and what you want done to that value(This is a placeholder). The index will show you the location of each item in the array(this will not make any changes to the original array). The array will return to you the original array before any changes were made.



3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destructuring is using keys in an object and giving it a variable to reach the properties. This is an easier way to call on the properties in an object. 

  Researched answer: Object destructuring is taking data from the object and assigning it to a variable to make it easier to call on each of the properties of each key. Object destructuring also allows you to use empty variables and can be filled with a value of your choice instead of a "hard" value. I believe the correct term is dynamic.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: A function is a block of code you can use to store in your "project" and call on your function anytime by using the variable you assigned it. A method is a function used inside of an object. Methods are local only. A time i got these 2 mixed up was when i was doing some .js challenges with a calssmate of mine. We used a method for every problem that required a function and relized this when we got to the last question asking us to use a method, which then confused us. Safe to say i won't be mistaking those 2 anymore!

  Researched answer: I have just learned a function is an object!(as well as an array is an object) Functions execute a list of instructions on different datatypes and has to have a return or your function will come back undefined. Functions are also recycleable! You can call on a function anytime you need that particular task done after you've made it. 
  A method is a set of instructions that involve properties in an object. A method can only be called on using dot notations or square bracket notations. A method is a function inside of an object.



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: An object is a collection of key values wrapped in a curly! - Austin(i think) Every object has its 
  keys: and :value. A class is the template for objects. Classes can hold more than one object inside of it.

  Researched answer: An object has properties and each property has its own value. ex: color(property) : orange(value). A class is the Template for the object! ex: car(class) { inside here will be objects } -->  ^^^^^^^^          ^^^^^^^^ 
Classes can be declared in 2 different wats, class declarations ans class expressions. delcaring it
 class = ??? or ??? = class



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: Creating an object class inside of an object class. //I kind of understand this. I believe it means a  value can have another set of values.

2. React: React is an open source front end library for JS React is used to make websites and mobile apps. React was used to build many bit websites including Facebook and Netflix! 

3. React state: A react state is a plain object in JS that starts with a default value when a component mounts. //I dont understand this one

4. React lifecycle methods: Every component in react has a lifecycle that can be manipulated only during the three main phases; Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting or "birth, growing, death" examples were used.

5. DOM: DOM stands for Document Object Model which is an API for HTML and XML documents. In HTML the DOM is !doctype <html><head><body>... so on. DOM represents the page to make changes on what is on the page and the style.
